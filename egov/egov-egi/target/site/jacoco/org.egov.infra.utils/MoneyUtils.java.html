     * Splits up an amount into multiple amounts according to the specified
     * weightage.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * E.g. An amount of 100 and weights (3, 7) will give (30, 70).
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * The algorithm used is the one described at
     * http://nida.se/patterns/poeaa/money.html. It guarantees that the sum of
     * the splits will exactly equal the input amount, even for fractional
     * cases:
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * E.g. An amount of 100 and weights (3, 8) will give (28, 72).
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * In such cases, the individual split amounts might not exactly match the
     * number you'd get from floating-point calculation (27.272 and 72.727 in
     * the example above). With the input amount in paise, the individual split
     * amounts will be at most 1 paisa off.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * It is the job of the caller to do the &quot;massaging&quot; of rupee amounts into
     * paise amounts, and vice-versa for the output.
     * &lt;p&gt;
     * See the unit tests for more examples.
     *
     * @param amountInPaise Has to be whole number, so if your amount is Rs. 100.342,
     *                      you'll have to convert that to 10034 paise.
     * @param weights       Numbers that specify the weight given to each split. They need
     *                      not add up to 100% (e.g. 3, 3, 4) - any arbitrary weights will
     *                      do. Also note that (2, 10, 16) is identical to (1, 5, 8).
     * @return The split amounts. If no weights or a single weight is input, the
     * input amount will be returned.
