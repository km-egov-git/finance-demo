 * This class overrides the default behaviour for transaction management. The transaction is marked for rollback, so that the HibSessionServletFilter further down the filter stack will rollback the
 * current transaction. For this to work, an exception mapping for the exception thrown needs to be defined in the struts.xml:

 * &lt;pre&gt;

 *           &amp;lt;result name=&amp;quot;genericError&amp;quot;&amp;gt;/error/error.jsp&amp;lt;/result&amp;gt;
